# Omnistack11: beTheHero

Project of a voluntary plataform that connects users & NGO's. This is another learning project, to test my own capacity of developing in *JavaScript* and its vast _developer_ environment. 

This is also part of the Omnistack 11.0, and it got there a basic structure that I intend to developer even more with some properties I find useful or want to prove some concepts.
